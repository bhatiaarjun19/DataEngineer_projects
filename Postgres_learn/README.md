This repository contains the ETL pipeline for populating the sparkifydb database.

    -   The goal of this database is to allow Sparkify to answer business questions about its users, the types of songs they listen to, and the artists who write those songs, using data from logs and files. The database serves as a consistent and dependable repository for this information.

    -   This data source will be useful in assisting Sparkify in achieving some of its analytical goals, such as identifying songs with the highest popularity or times of day with the highest traffic.
